                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Minimally invasive treatment of many cardio-, neuro-, and peripheral vascular conditions has surpassed open surgeries driven by numerous benefits, including fewer major adverse events, shorter hospital stays, and faster recovery. These endovascular procedures would not have been possible without fluoroscopy, which provides real-time images of the location and movement of therapeutic catheters inside the body. However, over the past two decades, there has been increasing scientific and clinical evidence that chronic exposure to fluoroscopy, which emits low-dose ionizing radiation, is putting interventional medical professionals at risk for serious health conditions, including cancer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In December 2018, ORSIF published the first economic analysis of the impact of these health-related occupational hazards, estimating annual costs of at least $49 million in the United States. This interactive web application updates that analysis using current federal economic valuations, workforce data, and clinical research. Based on updated parameters, the 2025 estimate has risen to approximately <strong>$88.7 million per year</strong>—an 81% increase from the 2018 baseline.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This estimate excludes the treatment of non-acute medical conditions, such as precursors to cataracts, cognitive decline, and risks to reproductive health. It also does not account for turnover costs of experienced physicians nor potential litigation from physicians or patients. Absent investment in radiation exposure control technologies, economic costs will likely continue to increase based on the continued shift to minimally invasive procedures.

                Based on data from medical colleges and boards, there are approximately 11,626 interventional physicians in the US. In addition, there are approximately 13,000 nurses and 11,300 technicians involved in fluoroscopy-guided interventional procedures. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports 64,700 "Cardiovascular Technologists and Technicians," but this broader category includes echo technicians, stress test technicians, and others not routinely exposed to fluoroscopy.

                Scientific evidence documenting the health risks that interventional healthcare professionals face
            </p>

            <div class="about-content">
                <h3>Cancer</h3>
                <p>
                    Exposure to even low-dose radiation increases the risk of developing cancer. The Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation (BEIR) Committee found that there is a linear dose-response relationship between exposure to radiation and the development of cancer.<sup>1</sup> At 100 mSv cumulative exposure—the estimated lifetime mean for interventional physicians—the risk of cancer is 1%.<sup>2</sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although 1% may seem low, OSHA considers 0.1% excess risk to be "significant." The incremental risk of 1% for cancer (1 in 100) is comparable to the risk of dying in a motor vehicle accident (1 in 112) or unintentional poisoning (1 in 109).<sup>3</sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Malignant brain tumors among interventional healthcare providers were first reported in 1997. Since that time, the number of malignant brain tumors recorded for interventional teams has grown to 43.<sup>4</sup> A Mayo Clinic study showed notably higher rates of breast cancer and leukemia among interventional HCPs compared to non-interventional HCPs.<sup>5</sup>
                </p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: var(--spacing-xl);">Musculoskeletal Disorders (MSDs)</h3>
                <p>
                    Interventional medical professionals wear leaded aprons and other personal protective equipment (PPE) to shield their bodies from scatter radiation. The weight of leaded PPE exerts continuous pressure on the spine, neck, hips, and knees. In addition, interventionalists often have to place their bodies in awkward positions to view monitors or maintain positioning behind radio-protective shields, which intensifies the strain that PPE places on the musculoskeletal system.<sup>6</sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the 2023 SCAI survey, 66% of interventional cardiologists reported musculoskeletal problems—up from 53% in 2018.<sup>7</sup> Interventional cardiologists are significantly more likely to have cervical disc disease and multiple spinal levels of disc involvement than other physician groups. The high incidence has led to concern that physicians in cath labs may face shortened careers, leading to a depletion of trained interventionalists.<sup>8</sup>
                </p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: var(--spacing-xl);">Cataracts</h3>
                <p>
                    Clinical studies show that roughly 50% of cath lab physicians develop detectable posterior subcapsular (PSC) lens opacities, the precursor to a cataract.<sup>9</sup> PSC lens opacities occur in interventional physicians up to 5 times more frequently than unexposed individuals in medical professions of the same age and sex. However, the average length of time for a recorded PSC lens opacity to progress to a cataract requiring medical intervention is unknown. As a result, this model does not assume an economic cost for this highly prevalent occupational hazard.
                </p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: var(--spacing-xl);">Premature Aging</h3>
                <p>
                    Studies within the Healthy Cath Lab project have shown that chronic exposure to fluoroscopy leads to the early onset of cognitive decline and subclinical atherosclerosis.<sup>10</sup> The average age of interventionalists who participated in neuropsychological testing was 46 for men and 43 for women. Compared to a control group, the interventionalists had lower scores on verbal long-term memory and fluency—left hemisphere activities—as well as short-term visual memory. The investigators commented that premature aging of the brain was a "neglected and underestimated" effect of chronic exposure to ionizing radiation.

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    With the growing evidence regarding the occupational hazards of fluoroscopy, steps need to be taken to safeguard the health of interventional teams who perform life-saving procedures, particularly as demand for complex, minimally invasive treatments is expected to increase. Because of lengthening procedure times, clinicians are assuming greater risk for a host of conditions—brain tumors, premature brain and vascular aging, early development of cataracts, and heightened risk of musculoskeletal injury—in their pursuit of improving the health of others.

                    As is well known, there are shortcomings with current PPE and radio-protective drapes, most notably orthopedic injury. Immediate attention from all stakeholders is needed to implement interventional lab tools, technologies, and protocols to safeguard HCPs from the adverse health effects of radiation, avoid the nearly $89 million in economic costs in the US, and enable the continued minimally invasive treatment of patients.

                <h2>About This Study</h2>
                <p>
                    This interactive web application updates the December 2018 ORSIF Economic Study, which first quantified the economic costs of occupational health hazards in interventional fluoroscopy. The methodology follows the original study's conservative approach while incorporating the latest available data on workforce demographics, economic valuations, and clinical outcomes.

                    Data sources include federal agencies (HHS, OSHA, BLS), medical specialty organizations (AAMC, ABIM, SCAI), peer-reviewed literature, and the National Safety Council. Some parameters use placeholder values where primary data was unavailable—these are clearly marked throughout the application.
